#simulation

This directory contains scripts for preparing configuration files for
Telescope Array simulation software (internal code called "TRUMP" and 
"UTAFD" that, in general terms, performs a detailed simulation of
how the telescope optics and electronics respond to the light
produced by a cosmic-ray air shower with known physical properties).
