# TelescopeArray
This repository is for code that I develop as part of my workflow
in performing research on the Telescope Array Experiment.

##python/ta\_common
Common code shared by various other projects listed below. 
*This code must be made available in the path*, for example, via
a symlink from site-packages. If this location changes from one
revision to the next, it will be necessary to update the path or
symlink manually.

##python/daqDB 

daqDB is a set of scripts that check the data from certain telescope stations,
which is organized into "DAQ parts."
