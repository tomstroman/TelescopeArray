# processFD

Raw data from the Telescope Array fluorescence detectors (FDs) must
undergo several stages of processing. Each stage is accomplished by
existing software, but ferrying the data from one step to the next
is a complicated procedure.

I previously wrote a number of Bash scripts to handle this, but I
believe I can simplify the process while also translating it into
Python. I will update this document as code is added.
